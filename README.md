“MOS Burgers” is locally-owned medium scale business that specialize in selling a wide
variety of burgers, submarines and soft drinks. On an average day, the shop serves between
50-60 customers. Additionally, Vito’s Burger shop offers various promotional deals and
discounts to their customers to enhance their dining experience.
Despite its popularity, the current method of handling transaction details and issuing bills relies
on manual, paper-based processes. As the number of customers visiting the shop continues to
grow daily, there is a need to streamline and modernize these operators.
